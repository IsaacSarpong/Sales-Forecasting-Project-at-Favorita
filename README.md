# Time_Series_ML_Project 

# Context 
The task at hand involves time series forecasting, where we will be working on predicting store sales using data from Corporation Favorita, a major grocery retailer based in Ecuador. The goal in this project is to develop a model that can provide more precise predictions for the unit sales of various items sold across different Favorita stores.
